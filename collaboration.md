## Annotations from other users

In tagtog you can collaborate with other users to annotate faster or improve the quality of annotations. Each user has a version of the annotations for a single document, e.g. _UserA _can have 20 annotations, _UserB_ can have 5 different annotations on the same exact document. In addition to these versions, each document has a `master `version which is usually treated as the final/official version.
