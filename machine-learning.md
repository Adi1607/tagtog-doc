  <p>One of the advantages using tagtog is the possibility of annotating text automatically using machine learning (ML) :bookmark_tabs: Why is this important? automatic annotations are just insights on the top of the text. You can use this intelligence to:</p>
  <p class="list-item"><span class="list-item-1"></span>tagtog annotates text automatically following your own rules or by using pre-trained models. This means you can <strong>automate</strong> processes to find relevant insights automatically. E.g. analyze customer feedback on real time.</p>
  <p class="list-item"><span class="list-item-2"></span>Automatic annotations can <strong>boost annotator performance</strong>. Documents are already pre-annotated using these and annotators just need to correct wrong predictions if required. tagtog learns from feedback and provide with more accurate results with each iteration.</p>
  <p class="list-item"><span class="list-item-3"></span><strong>Index your data</strong>. Use automatic annotations to augment your data and improve discoverability (e.g. augment records with mutation mentions using standard names, easier to find). You can either import the results into your own system or use the <a href="/API.html#search-documents-in-a-project-get" title="Search API">Search API</a> to find suitable records across the data imported.</p>
