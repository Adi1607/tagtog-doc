A project is a collection of documents and rules to annotate documents manually or automatically. Create a new project is the starting point for each user.

## Creating a project
1. Once you have signed up and you have a user account, you are **ready to create a new project**:

2. You can now briefly **define your project**:

* **Project name** (mandatory): choose a name for your project.
* **Description** (optional): what is the problem you are trying to solve? describe it briefly. It can help other users to understand your goal.
* **Domain**: tagtog has built-in some magic to process more effectively specific domains (e.g. biomedical). If the text you plan to analyze is not related to any of the domains in the list, please select the option `other`.
* **Language**: Right now only English is supported.
* **Entities**: We have some already built "machines" that can help you to identify relevant information (entities in this case) in the text from the scratch. Currently these are related to the biomedical field: GGP (Gene or Gene Product), Organism, Mutation, [SNO
