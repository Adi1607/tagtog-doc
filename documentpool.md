# Document pool

* TOC
{:toc}

> **What is a document?** Any fragment of text. It can be plain text or have one of the formats (PDF, HTML, XML, etc.) defined here: [input formats](https://github.com/tagtog/tagtog-doc/wiki/Input-File-Formats)

In the **pool** you store your documents. We will use _pool view_ to refer to the screen listing your documents.

The pool is paginated and you can change move to the next or previous page using the navigation menu.

# Manually confirmed documents

Manually confirmed (or completed) documents are those which have **all the annotations reviewed by a human**. This action is usually performed to a document as annotation-review-complete or ready for training a machine/AI. In the pool view, you can see if a document has been marked as confirmed when the checkmark is in green. You can see the difference between a confirmed document and another not confirmed below:

# Test folder

Use the test folder to test the **performance of the machine learning methods**. Add here a few documents and annotate them manually. These, so called **gold documents**, will never be used for real training. 

> Only mind the test folder if you are using machine learning to annotate automatically.
